# 7343 Homework 1

In this homework, your goal is to implement and train two LSTM models, one called piano music composer and the other called critic.  

## Data
The piano data (in midi format) can be downloaded from: 
https://storage.googleapis.com/magentadata/datasets/maestro/v1.0.0/maestro-v1.0.0-midi.zip

The file "midi2seq.py" contains a set of functions that help to process the midi data and convert the data to sequences of events.   
The file "model_base.py" contains the base classes that you should inherit when implementing the following model classes.

## Critic
(This should be a subclass of the class CriticBase.)
You should implement a multi-layer (>=2 layers) LSTM model in this class. The Model (the score function) takes a sequence of envents as input and outputs a score judging whether the piano music corresponding to the sequence is good music or bad music. A function to generate random music is provided in the "midi2seq.py". Use the function to create a collection of random piano plays as examples of bad music. Use the piano plays in the downloaded data as example of good music. (You don't need to use all the downloaded data. A sufficiently large subset will be enough.) Train the model in this class using both the good and the bad examples.    

## Composer
(This should be a subclass of the class ComposerBase.)
You should implement a multi-layer (>=2 layers) LSTM model in this class. When the compose member function is called, it should return a sequence of events. Randomness is require in the implementation of the compose function such that each call to the function should generate a different sequence. The function "seq2piano" in "midi2seq.py" can be used to convert the sequence into a midi object, which can be written to a midi file and played on a computer. Train the model as a language model (autoregression) using the downloaded piano plays.

## Composer VS Critic 
Use your Critic model to score the music generated by your composer. Compose 50 music sequences and score them using the Critic. 
  - What is the average score of the generated music? 
  - Propose an approach to improve the quality of your composed music.
  - What major difficulty do you expect to encounter when using the above proposed approach?
